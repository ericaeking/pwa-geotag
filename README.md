This is a simple demonstration of a Progressive Web App (PWA) with pure JavaScript and geotagging features, processed by PHP on the backend.

Here's how the project flow works:

When using the web app, capturing a picture initiates geotagging. Details such as latitude, longitude, weather conditions, full address, and a logo are incorporated into the picture.

API to get full address: <a href="https://geocode.maps.co/">Geocode Maps API</a><br>
API to get current weather: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a> (You need to register an account and get your own API key)
